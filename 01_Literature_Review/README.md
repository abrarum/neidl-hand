## A collection of papers that focus on separating backgrounds and hands
Note: Most of the very recent papers employ neural networks to do hand and finger recognition. 
For the sake of brevity and because we decided against NN only solutions in the first place, those papers are omitted. 

| Authors |	Title |	Hand Segmentation |	Gestures detected by | Thoughts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Yoon, Soh,Bae,Yang |	Hand gesture recognition using combined features of location, angle and velocity |	by skin colour |	Hand Movement	
Binh, Shuchi, Ejima |	Real-Time Hand Tracking and Gesture Recognition System |	by skin colour |	Hand Movement	
Hong, Rurk, Huang |	Gesture Modeling and Recognition using Finite State Machines |	by skin colour |	Hand Movement |	not useful, focuses on hand movement only
Chen, Fu, Huang |	Hand gesture recognition using a real-time tracking method and hidden Markov models	| by skin colour and motion | Hand Movement but no exact definition of gesture |	may improve hand detection overall, more complex but can deal with complex backgrounds
Zhang, Lin, Zhao | A Fast Algorith for Hand Gesture Recognition Using Relief |	by skin colour |	Hand & Finger Positions |	hints how to obtain threshold values
