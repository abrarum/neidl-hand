## Readme from the repo I cloned is as follows:

OpenCV comes with a trainer as well as a detector. If you want to train your own classifier for any object like a car, planes, etc. you can use OpenCV to create one. Its full details are given here: Cascade Classifier Training.
Here we will deal with detection. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smile, etc. Those XML files are stored in opencv/data/haarcascades/ Folder. Let's create a face detector with OpenCV.

## Environment I have on my machine to run this:

OS-> linux
python-> 2.7.15+
openCV2 (not sure about the version installed for now)
# may be this tutorial will help you for installing openCV

## How to Run the file

# command:
#this makes the file executable
$ chmod +x FaceDetection.py 
#this will run the program
$ python FaceDetection.py

## Note:
please make sure to have good lights in the room or in surroundings for better results
